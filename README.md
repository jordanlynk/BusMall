# BusMall Lab Catalog

# What this website will do

- This webpage will act as a place for users to come to the site to vote on products that could potentially be sold within the BusMall catalog. Upon entering the site, users will be given a set of instructions on how to vote. Users are prompted to select 1 of 3 products displayed, 25 times. Once they have voted 25 times, they can then click on "display your results" button to see their overall voting and even the frequency of how much something is voted on, through multiple voting rounds. For BusMall, they will be able to look into their local storage and find the results logged from each individual users voting.
